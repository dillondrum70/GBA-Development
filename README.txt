You can run the Visualboy Advance executable from Emu/VisualBoyAdvance/VisualBoyAdvance.exe and drag 
the .gba file into the window.  It will run automatically.

Alternatively:

In order to compile the program, double click Mdrive.bat which will mount the folder to your M drive.

Next, run Notepad++.bat which comes with extra tools allowing you to compile ARM assembly.

Open CSI370/GBA_Project/GBA_Drummond.asm

Press F6 with a project open to compile from the current file.

Visualboy Advance should automatically open with the game.
